Easy to use migraine tracker. When experiencing a migraine, you know you need to keep track of symptoms and how things are progressing but looking at screens can be difficult. Trakit aims to make this process easier by focusing on the most important data so you can focus on feeling better while still having the data available to discuss with your neurologist.
